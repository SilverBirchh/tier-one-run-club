Before we get into the details, the structure of this session is incredibly simple.

You’ll run **14 reps of 100 seconds**, and your recovery will **start at 120 seconds and drop by 10 seconds each rep**. All you need to do is pick a distance you think you can hit every time.

That’s it.

Everyone runs for the **same amount of time**, not the same distance. The challenge builds rep by rep as the recoveries shrink. The goal is to not go crazy at the start and conserve energy for the later rounds.

### How It Works

· Run **100 seconds**
· Start from your group’s track marker  
· Aim to hit your chosen distance before the whistle  
· **Recovery starts at the whistle**, not when you finish  
· Recoveries: **2:00 → 1:50 → 1:40 → …** until rep 14  
· If you miss your target, **reduce the distance and keep going**

Everyone stays in. No elimination. Just adjust and carry on.

### An Example

If you’re aiming for **450 m per rep**, you might start at the **50 m marker** on the home straight.

· If you hit it comfortably early on, you can walk back or stay where you finish  
· As recoveries shrink, staying where you finish becomes easier  
· If you’re consistently missing the line, shorten the distance by roughly **50 m**

Your score is how many reps you complete at your **original target**.

By rep 10, it should feel very real.

There’s **no recovery before the last rep**. You’ll hear a **double whistle** and go again.

Expect roughly **3:20 of continuous running** to finish the session.

This part is all about grit and determination!

This session is brilliant because it:

· Builds **speed endurance**  
· Teaches pacing under **accumulating fatigue**  
· Improves **recovery efficiency**  
· Keeps the whole group working together, regardless of pace
