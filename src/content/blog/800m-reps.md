We tackled a true classic at the club this week - 800m repeats! It's easy to remember, accessible for runners of all levels, and delivers an incredible workout. Whether you're new to intervals or a seasoned champ, 800m repeats will help build both speed and endurance.

The session structure is simple: run 800m at a hard effort, followed by a 400m recovery jog. Depending on your fitness level, you'll repeat this pattern anywhere from 4 to 7 times. You should aim to keep a consistent pacing on the hard efforts - if you start too fast, the later reps will suffer. This workout should leave you quite tired by the end, but your fitness will be massively improved.


This workout is a powerful tool for improving multiple aspects of your running fitness. The 800m distance hits a sweet spot - it's long enough to challenge your aerobic system but short enough to maintain quality throughout each rep. Running these intervals at 5k pace or faster helps develop your lactate threshold (the intensity at which your body can clear lactate as quickly as it produces it), while also boosting your VO2 max (your body's maximum oxygen uptake capacity).

The 400m recovery jogs between reps serve a dual purpose. They allow enough rest to maintain high quality on the hard efforts, while keeping you moving to practice running on fatigued legs. This combination of hard efforts and active recovery trains your body to buffer lactic acid more effectively and improves your running economy - essentially teaching you to run faster while using less energy.

Regular sessions of 800m repeats can lead to significant improvements in both your speed and endurance. You'll likely notice the benefits across all race distances, from sharper finishing kicks in 5ks to stronger performances in longer events like half marathons. Plus, the mental toughness required to maintain form and pace when fatigue sets in will serve you well in races of any distance.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
Each hard rep should be run at a challenging pace but one that you can consistently maintain throughout the session. There is a generous amount of recovery time built in, so you should be able to go quite quickly. Try to run at around your current 5km race pace or faster.

**Recovery Instructions**  
Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop.
