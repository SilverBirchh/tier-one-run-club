We tackled a true classic at the club this week - 800m repeats! It's easy to remember, accessible for runners of all levels, and delivers an incredible workout. Whether you're new to intervals or a seasoned champ, 800m repeats will help build both speed and endurance.

The session structure is simple: run 800m at a hard effort, followed by a 400m recovery jog. Depending on your fitness level, you'll repeat this pattern anywhere from 4 to 7 times. You should aim to keep consistent pacing on the hard efforts - if you start too fast, the later reps will suffer. This workout should leave you quite tired by the end, but your fitness will be massively improved.

Your body is doing a lot during each hard rep and improving a few different systems that all contribute to you running faster and further.

**VO2 Max Development**  
Running at these high intensities forces your heart to pump more blood with each beat and your lungs to process oxygen more efficiently. Each hard rep forces your cardiovascular system to work near its limit. It's like working out but for your heart. You are increasing the limit that it can work at and for longer so you can run harder.

**Lactate Threshold Improvements**  
As your body gets tired through the workout, your muscles produce more lactate. This creates that burning sensation in your legs. By repeatedly creating more lactate and then recovering and removing it from your system, your body becomes better at processing lactate. It's like training your muscles to be better at handling the "burn" - they literally develop more cellular machinery to process lactate, pushing your threshold higher.

**Running Economy Enhancement**  
The combination of running fast when tired helps refine your running form under pressure. Even when tired, your body learns to maintain efficient running form. This is similar to practising any skill - over time, your body finds better ways to execute the movement, requiring less energy to maintain the same pace.

**Mental Toughness**  
Finally, there's also the psychological aspect. Each set of 800m repeats is long enough to hurt but you know you're going to get through it. Your brain learns to cope with that discomfort while maintaining focus on form and pace. You're learning to keep your eye on the target while maintaining your running form.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
Each hard rep should be run at a challenging pace but one that you can consistently maintain throughout the session. There is a generous amount of recovery time built in, so you should be able to go quite quickly. Try to run at around your current 5km race pace or faster.

**Recovery Instructions**  
Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop.
