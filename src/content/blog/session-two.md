For my second track session I took a session from The Running Channel. It is a session that Olympian Andy Baddley used to do when he was training. It's a session that quickly builds up lactic acid in the legs and forces the athlete to be mentally strong. The session is 1km @ your 5km pace. Then 90 seconds (200m) rest. Then a hard 400m @ mile pace. Then 400m jog recovery.

This is very quick session. The 400m jog recovery helps to flush out the lactic built up over the 400m. It also means that the 1km rep doesn't feel to bad. This is repeated 4 times. By the final 400m the athlete is going to be pretty tired. But this is what we want because it simulates coming to the end of a race!

At this session I also settled on drills that I wanted to run before the session.

1. Toe Walking
2. Heel Walking
3. Rhythm Skip
4. Bounding
5. High Knees
6. Butt Kicks
7. Strides
<br /><br />


These should help the runner get warmed up and be ready to run hard!
