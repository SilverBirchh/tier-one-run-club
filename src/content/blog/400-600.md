Running around the track doesn't have to be boring! By mixing up the hard distances and recoveries, you get a fast, exciting workout that flies by! This session is more of a Fartlek workout where each set consists of 2 x 400m and 1 x 600m. After each 400m, there is a 200m recovery, while after the 600m there is a 400m recovery.

Within each set, you're working very hard, especially as you step up to the 600m final segment. But this is what makes this session great â€“ you're teaching your body to go that little bit extra and work that little bit harder. This will help on race day when you come to the finish line and need to push on. The 400m recovery between each set gives you ample time to fully recover and maintain your pace.

This workout is designed for 5K-10K runners to build speed. It's also great during cross-country season!

As always, make sure that you warm up beforehand with a 15-minute jog, activation exercises, strides, and some dynamic stretches. Once the session is complete, cool down with a light jog and stretches to help recovery.

At the club, we work with four different levels of ability, where group 1 is the slower group and the ability increases from there. You should pick your group depending on your 5K time.

### Session Details

**Pacing:** Each hard effort should be run just a little faster than your current 5K pace. You should run the 400m and 600m segments at a consistent pace throughout this session.  
**Recovery:** With the 200m recoveries, you don't have long, but you don't want to come to a complete stop. It's best to transition to a light jog during these. With the 400m recoveries, take your time to properly recover and move the lactate out of your legs.
