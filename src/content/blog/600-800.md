Recently at the running club we've been doing a lot of shorter distances so this week we pickled it up and went for some longer distances. And to keep it interesting we were varied the hard rep distances. This is a great session to build the strength you need for racing. There are shorter recoveries after the first hard rep in the session to keep the intensity high. At the end of each set there is a longer recovery so that you can hit the next set with the same quality.

This workout is ideal for 5K-10K runners and half marathoners looking to build strength. It's particularly effective during base-building phases of training.

The session helps build strength by improving lactate tolerance and 

As always, make sure that you warm up beforehand with a 15-minute jog, activation exercises, strides, and some dynamic stretches. Once the session is complete, cool down with a light jog and stretches to aid recovery.

At the club, we work with four different levels of ability, where group 1 is the slower group and the ability increases from there. You should pick your group depending on your 5K time.

### Session Details

**Pacing:** Each hard effort should be run just at your current 5K pace. The longer rep in the set can be taken at a slightly slower pace. You should aim to keep the hard reps at a consistent pace.
**Recovery:** The 200m recoveries should be a light jog. Use the 400m recoveries to properly recover before the next set.
