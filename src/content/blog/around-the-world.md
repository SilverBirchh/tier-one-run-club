It's always tough training after the Christmas break. You're trying to get back in to the rhythm, getting but this is a great session allowing you to get faster and faster as you go. You start with a hard 900m and 100m recovery and each rep the hard drops down by 100m while the recovery increases by 100m. At the start the session is focused on VO2 max. You don't have enough time to clear the lactate build up so you have to work hard to get faster through each rep. As it comes to the back half of the session its all about anaerobic speed.

## The Session

**Hard / Recovery (metres)**  
900 / 100  
800 / 200  
700 / 300  
600 / 400  
500 / 500  
400 / 600  
300 / 700  
200 / 800  
100  

With the early reps you need patience and control. As the distances shorten and the recovery grows the pace should pick up with it.

**Group 1**  
Skip: 800 / 200, 700 / 300, 600 / 400  
Start at the **300m line**

**Group 2**  
Skip: 800 / 200 and 700 / 300  
Start at the **100m line**

**Group 3**  
Skip: 800 / 200  
Start at the **300m line**

**Group 4**  
**Full set**

Everyone comes together for the final **100m sprint**, it's great fun and such a rare thing to do!
