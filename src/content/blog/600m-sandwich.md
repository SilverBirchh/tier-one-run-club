This week at the club, our main goal was to let runners experiment with a faster pace group than usual. We designed a session with multiple transition points, allowing runners to drop back to their regular group if the pace proved too challenging. We chose a sandwich-style workout that had two clear opportunities to adjust groups.

The session consists of three parts: an initial set of 600m repeats with 200m recovery intervals, followed by a tempo run ranging from 2km to 3km, and concluding with another set of 600m repeats with 200m recoveries. Before each change-over runners have the opportunity to change groups. It allows them to try out the faster pace without worrying that they might miss some of the session of have to drop out entirely.

This is an excellent session even if you're not testing out a faster pace group! The tempo run in the middle creates a perfect break point, allowing you to really attack the 600m repeats. These repeats should be run faster than your current 5km pace, and with the short recovery intervals, the workout goes by super quickly.

The tempo run is ideally done as a group, adding a collaborative element to the session. You can use the "back-to-front" format, where runners form a single line and take turns accelerating from the back to the front. When one runner reaches the front, the next person at the back begins their acceleration. This builds team spirit while maintaining the workout's intensity as you power to the front of the group. This should be run at a challenging pace for the group. I suggest around 10km pace.

As always, please be sure to warm up before diving in and starting. A 15-minute jog, activation exercises, strides, and dynamic stretches should do it. After completing the session, cool down with a light jog and stretches to help recovery.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
The 600m should be run faster than your current 5km pace. The tempo run in the middle provides recovery time before the next 600m set. The tempo run should be run at your current 10km pace.

**Recovery Instructions**  
Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop. The recoveries are short in this session.
