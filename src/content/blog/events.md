I've been thinking a lot recently about why we run. We might run to lose weight, to win medals, or to chase PBs. But at the end of the day, I believe we run for fun. That's why Run Clubs have exploded in popularity lately—they blast music, you run, and you have a great time.

One of my goals is to organize running events that prioritize fun, while still blending in a bit of competitive spirit. With that in mind, here are a few of the events I’d love to create!

### Race Across London
This event is a race across London, starting at King's Cross and covering about 20 kilometers. Participants will be given three secret checkpoints but won’t know the next one until they reach the current checkpoint—much like how the show *Race Across the World* works! The event encourages participants to rely on their knowledge of London and teamwork, offering a unique opportunity to bond and explore the city in a new way.

### Monopoly Run
In this challenge, runners race to visit as many real-life London locations from the Monopoly board game as possible. Teams will have one hour to reach as many spots as they can and record them. The winner will be the team whose visited streets add up to the highest total value, based on their Monopoly board prices.

### King of the Hill
This challenge is all about conquering a tricky hill. Runners will be grouped by categories, such as male, female, and veterans. The event consists of multiple rounds where each group runs up the hill; in each round, the last person to reach the top is eliminated, until only one runner is left standing!

If anyone is interested in organizing these events with me, please get in touch!
