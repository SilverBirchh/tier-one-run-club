Not all sessions have to be all about speed. This sessions focuses on a controlled race pace that works on your ability to run faster for longer. A threshold pace is one that you can maintain for about an hour. For this workout you run at threshold pace for a set number of laps, run a set of 600 repeats and ending with laps at threshold pace. You don't have to run this at the track and works on any road route that you can find.

This session is designed to develop your lactate threshold and speed endurance simultaneously - two crucial elements for racing success. The threshold runs at the beginning and end teach your body to process lactate more efficiently while running at a sustained, challenging pace. By sandwiching faster 600m repeats between these threshold efforts, you're training your body to handle speed work under fatigue, much like the closing stages of a race. This combination of endurance and speed in a single session is super effective for improving the systems you'll rely on during races!

## Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
The threshold run should be run at a pace you can maintain for an hour.  
The 600m should be run at your mile pace.

**Recovery Instructions**  
After the threshold run and each 600m rep you should take 200m jog - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop.
