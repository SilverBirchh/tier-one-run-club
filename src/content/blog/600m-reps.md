We tackled a true classic at the club this week - 600m repeats! It's easy to remember, accessible for runners of all levels, and delivers an incredible workout.

The session structure is simple: run 600m at a hard effort, followed by a 200m recovery jog. Depending on your fitness level, you'll repeat this pattern anywhere from 6 to 10 times. You should aim to keep consistent pacing on the hard efforts - if you start too fast, the later reps will suffer. This workout should leave you quite tired by the end, but your fitness will be massively improved.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
Each hard rep should be run at a challenging pace but one that you can consistently maintain throughout the session. There is a generous amount of recovery time built in, so you should be able to go quite quickly. Try to run at around your current 5km race pace.

**Recovery Instructions**  
Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop.
