Short sharp reps make for a punchy session! Nothing beats flying around the the track and 100 miles an hour for 200m! This track session is built up of sets of 600m, 400m, 200m. It's a great way to try out different paces and how your body reacts to them. Have you gone off too fast for the 600m and can't find another gear for the 400m? No problem, another set is coming around the corner to give it another go. While this session is a great vo2 max builder, it's also about that exploration. Sometimes you need that in running! You'll need your team mates in this one to go for the faster paces!
