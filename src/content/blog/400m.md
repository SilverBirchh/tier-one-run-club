This week's session was called the "Triple 400m Blitz"! It consisted of three sets of 400m repeats, with an extended 800m recovery between each set. Within each set, runners took a 200m recovery between the repeats. The number of 400m reps per set varied based on ability, ranging from 2 to 4.

This workout is super effective because it allows runners to maintain a fast pace over a substantial volume. The hard intervals should be run just slightly quicker than your current 5km pace. The inclusion of the 800m recovery between sets sets this workout apart from simply running 12 x 400m with 200m recoveries. With the longer recovery, the body has time to partially replenish muscle glycogen stores, which helps sustain those bursts of high-intensity effort. It also enables the clearance of accumulated lactate, enabling you to maintain a higher quality of pace throughout the session. Meanwhile, the shorter 200m recoveries within each set still challenge the body to clear lactate when tired, providing dual benefits for both lactate clearance and speed development.

This structure also helps mental focus. Completing each set gives a sense of achievement and a natural break point, allowing you to reset mentally before tackling the next set. It is quite similar to race day scenarios where different segments demand varying levels of intensity, such as surges uphill or stretches where the pace can be more controlled. This helps build mental resilience and pacing strategies for race day.

### Session Details

**Pacing:** Aim to run the 400m intervals at a pace that is challenging yet sustainable throughout the workout. You should feel like you're working hard, but not burning out early.  
**Recovery:** The 800m recovery between sets is designed to help you maintain a fast pace throughout the entire session. Use it to jog or walk at a steady pace, keeping the legs moving.
