As the year winds down its time to have a bit of fun and a bit of competition! The first half gets the heart rate up and the legs full of lactate. Then the second half everyone gets in to teams and we crown the festive relay winner.

### Part One

We’ll kick off with the usual warm-up, followed by a short interval set to get the legs turning and the heart rate up:

Group 1: 2 × 800m (200m recovery) + 400m  
Group 2: 3 × 800m (200m recovery)  
Group 3: 4 × 800m (200m recovery)  
Group 4: 5 × 800m (200m recovery)  

**Pacing:** The 800m efforts should be at your 5k race pace. Focus on smooth transitions between efforts.

**Recovery:** 200m walk after each 800m before starting the next set. Really take the 200m nice and slow.

### The Main Event: Festive Relays 🎄

Once everyone’s warmed up, we’ll regroup and split into **teams of four**. Every runner completes **every race**, so teamwork and consistency matter just as much as raw speed. Rotate around who runs which leg each time.

**The Ladder:**  

4 × 100m  
4 × 200m  
4 × 300m  
4 × 400m  
4 × 500m  
4 × 400m  
4 × 300m  
4 × 200m  
4 × 100m (double points final!)  

Short, fast, painful, fun!  

**Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year**
