This week's workout was "600m dropdowns." This session consists of sets of 600m, 400m, and 200m intervals, all with 200m recoveries after each rep, repeated 3-6 times depending on your fitness level. You should start at 5km pace and get progressively quicker for the 400m and 200m.

This workout is particularly effective because it targets multiple aspects that improve your running ability. The 600m intervals at 5km pace are designed to improve your lactate threshold - the point at which your body produces lactate faster than it can remove it. When you're running, that burning sensation in your muscles is partly due to lactate build up. By training at this threshold, you're teaching your body to process lactate more efficiently, allowing you to maintain faster paces for longer periods.

The 400m intervals push you into VO2 max territory. VO2 max is your body's maximum capacity to transport and use oxygen during exercise. By running these intervals at 3km pace, you're challenging your cardiovascular system to improve its oxygen delivery and usage efficiency. The better your body becomes at using oxygen, the faster you'll be able to run

The 200m intervals, run at mile pace, develop your anaerobic capacity - your ability to produce energy without oxygen. Plus, they build mental strength. These fast intervals teach your body to proper form even when tired, which is vital for that final kick during races.

After completing the session, cool down with 10-15 minutes of easy jogging followed by light stretching to promote recovery.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
Each set should start at your current 5km pace for the 600m, 3km pace for the 400m, and your mile pace for the 200m.

**Recovery Instructions**  
Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop. The recovery time should be consistent after each hard rep and set. If you're timing it, take 2 minutes.
