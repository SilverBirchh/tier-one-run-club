If you're a runner, you know the value of **putting down markers** and being able to measure progress. A few weeks ago, we did that with the bleep test. This week, we were back at it with another classic: the **Cooper Aerobic Test**! This test of cardiovascular endurance was immediately followed by a solid set of 600m repeats to really push us.

### Part 1: Cooper’s Aerobic Test

The Cooper Test is a simple, yet brutal, measure of cardiovascular fitness. The goal is to see exactly how far you can run in **12 minutes**. We started and finished everyone precisely on a whistle.

It’s great to have a baseline to measure our progress against. The target distances below are designed to be achievable and offer a clear goal for your age group. We'll try this again in 6 months to see improvements!

| Age Group | Male (M) | Female (F) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 20-29 | 2800 m | 2400 m |
| 30-39 | 2700 m | 2400 m |
| 40-49 | 2500 m | 2200 m |
| 50-59 | 2300 m | 2000 m |
| 60+ | 2100 m | 1800 m |

For the mathematically minded the test can also be used to estimate V02 max using the formula:  
**VO2 max (ml/kg/min) = (distance in metres - 504.9) / 44.73**

Let's look at how this works. Suppose a runner covers **2,400 metres** in the 12-minute test.

**Calculate the top part (numerator):**  
    2400 - 504.9 = 1895.1

**Divide by the bottom part (denominator):**  
    1895.1 / 44.73 = approx 42.36

Therefore, the estimated **VO2 max** for this runner would be **42.36 ml/kg/min**. See how close your watch estime is as close to the estimate here!

### Part 2: The Main Workout - 600m Repeats

The test doesn't take too long so afterwards you can transitioned into some classic intervals. The focus was on maintaining a strong, controlled pace for the 600m efforts with a consistent 200m recovery in between.

**Pacing:** Run the 600m reps at your current 5km race pace.

**Recovery:** 200m walk after each 600m. Really take the 200m nice and slow.

**Group 1:**  
3 x 600s with 200m recoveries  

**Group 2:**  
4 x 600s with 200m recoveries  

**Group 3:**  
5 x 600s with 200m recoveries  

**Group 4:**  
6 x 600s with 200m recoveries
