Winter training can be tough, particularly when the track gets icy and temperatures drop. This is where the "Descend the Mountain" session is the best! Unlike traditional sprint workouts where cold muscles could lead to injury, this session's structure provides a natural, progressive warm-up that keeps you safe and performing at your best.

You'll begin with a 1600m interval at your current 10km pace - a comfortable starting point that allows your muscles to warm up thoroughly. As the distances gradually decrease, your pace increases. By the time you reach the final 200m sprint, your muscles are fully prepared for maximum effort.

This session can be done by anyone, at any running level. Beginners might work through five intervals (1600m down to 200m), while more advanced runners can tackle up to eight decreasing intervals.

For recovery, it is a light jog for 400m between the longer intervals, switching to 200m recoveries for the shorter, faster reps. This keeps your muscles warm and primed and makes sure you flush out most of the built-up lactate before the next rep. You shouldn't be coming to a complete stop during the recoveries, otherwise you may get too cold!

The primary benefit of this session is learning to get faster while fatigued. As each rep goes on, your muscles become tired but you need to increase the pace for each rep. Therefore, you're pushing those muscles to work harder as the session goes on. Equally, you're pushing yourself mentally as it gets harder to continue. This is exactly like a race. It starts very controlled but as the race develops, you're slowly pressing on the accelerator, even though you may be tired. By replicating that in a controlled environment like the track, you'll perform better on race day!

As always, please be sure to warm up before diving in and starting. A 15-minute jog, activation exercises, strides, and dynamic stretches should do it. After completing the session, cool down with a light jog and stretches to help recovery.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
Start at your current 10km race pace and decrease by 5-10 seconds per lap. For example, if you begin at 4:00/km pace, your next rep should be at 3:55/km, and continue getting faster. Finish with an all-out sprint for the final 200m.

**Recovery Instructions**  
Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop. This is especially crucial during the 400m recoveries to prevent muscles from cooling down and seizing up in cold weather.
