A few weeks ago at the track we tried out varying the pace during a rep by incorporating a hard effort in the middle. The session was a hit, and I really enjoyed the workout. It was an opportunity to practice that final race kick and test how well your body can handle it when you're fatigued. This week we're doing it again, but with a twist. We're keeping the hard reps consistent at 800m, but changing the recovery time...

‣ 800m interval (5K pace + final 200m sprint)  
‣ 200m recovery  
‣ 800m interval  
‣ 400m recovery  
‣ And so on...  

This is a great session that works both your lactate threshold and your VO2 max. The 5K pace builds your lactate threshold - your ability to process lactate at higher intensities without accumulating it too quickly. Improving your lactate threshold allows you to sustain faster paces for longer periods without fatigue setting in, resulting in better race performances across all distances. A higher lactate threshold means you can maintain a more quicker race pace throughout the entire distance instead of slowing down in the later stages.

Then the final 200m sprint at mile pace pushes you well above threshold, creating that familiar burning sensation as lactate accumulates rapidly. This combination trains your body to better clear lactate while developing the mental strength to push through discomfort.

The alternating recovery pattern is works because the shorter 200m recoveries don't allow for complete lactate clearance before the next effort, forcing your body to adapt to processing lactate more efficiently. Meanwhile, the longer 400m recoveries let you recharge enough to maintain quality in the harder efforts - giving you the best of both worlds.

## Session Details

**Pacing**  
The 800m should be run at your current 5km pace, with the final 200m at your mile pace.

**Recovery**  
After each 800m rep, you'll have either a 200m or 400m recovery. Start with 200m and alternate after that. Recovery should be a light jog and be consistent. If 400m takes you 4 minutes, the 200m should take 2 minutes.
