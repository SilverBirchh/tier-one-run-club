After running the Barcelona Marathon in March 2024, I felt on top of the world. I had run a time I was really happy with and was looking forward to new PBs. I was getting a lot of praise from my running buddies and basically thought I was invincible. Because of that, I started to increase my weekly mileage. Two weeks after the marathon, I had a 34 km week, then 54 km, 72 km, 84 km, and finally a 100 km week. I thought what I was doing was sensible, but after that 100 km week, I felt a sharp pain in my knee during my next run. I tried to push through it, but the pain worsened, and I had to stop.

After some initial research and a physio appointment, it was diagnosed as **Runner's Knee**!

This was terrible news, and I was gutted. In the end, I had to take three weeks off running and slowly build back before I could resume my usual weekly mileage.

### Recovering from Runner's Knee

Recovering from an injury involves both physical and mental preparation. Maybe "recover" isn't the right word for the mental aspect—"prepare" might be better. You have to prepare yourself for weeks without running, which can be tough when running is your release. Accepting this reality early on is crucial. Otherwise, you risk rushing the recovery process, coming back too soon, or doing more damage. The injury will heal, and you’ll be back to running—whether it takes three weeks or eight. Once you've accepted that, the recovery process becomes much more manageable, and you're less likely to worsen the injury. 

Honestly, taking a break from running can be beneficial. I’ve found that an extended break helps relieve knots and reignites motivation. It’s said that fitness loss doesn’t occur until after 10 days, and even then, you're only losing about 2-3% of your VO2 Max, which is easily regained once you return to running.

To recover physically, there are a few key steps you should take:

**Stop Running**

Stop running right away—that should go without saying! Don’t try to push through the pain. Take a week off and test it out afterward. If you still feel pain, continue resting. Once the pain is gone, ease back into running gradually. Start with a 3 km run, and resist the temptation to jump back to your pre-injury mileage. That’s just going to bring the injury right back! Start with 3 km, take a day off, then 4 km, day off, 5 km. That’s all you need to do that week. If that feels good, continue building up, but make sure to increase mileage by **no more than 10% each week**. This is where I went wrong initially. Your muscles need time to adapt to the increased load, and pushing too hard too fast will only lead to more pain!

**Stretching**

Stretching is crucial for improving flexibility in the knee and keeping muscles flexible, strong, and healthy. I used to neglect stretching, which could be why I get injured so often, but it’s vital in injury recovery. When muscles around the hips, hamstrings, and quads are tight, they put extra stress on the knees, increasing the risk of injury. Consistent stretching helps maintain proper joint alignment and reduces strain on the knees.

Focus on areas that affect knee mobility, like your quads, hip flexors, and hamstrings. My stretching routine looks like this (repeat 3 times):

1. 30 seconds Calf Stretch
2. 30 seconds Hip Flexor and Quad Stretch
3. 30 seconds Hamstring Stretch
4. 30 seconds Standing IT Band Stretch

These stretches will help speed up your recovery!

**Strength Exercises**

Strengthening the muscles around the knee is essential for preventing misalignment and reducing the risk of Runner's Knee. If you feel any pain while doing strength exercises, stop immediately and consider consulting a doctor. I follow the NHS guidance [here](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/knee-exercises-for-runners/).

1. Wall Sit - 3 sets / 45 seconds
2. Squats - 3 sets / 45 seconds
3. Lunges - 2 sets / 45 seconds, each leg
4. Calf Raises - 2 sets / 45 seconds, each leg
5. Single Leg Glute Bridge - 2 sets / 45 seconds, each leg

I also find value in core work. A strong core improves stability, reducing the risk of overloading one knee. I follow this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgI_p8bKg78&pp=ygUWMjAgbWludXRlIGNvcmUgd29ya291dA%3D%3D)—it’s only 20 minutes long and is a killer workout. Combine it with the knee-strengthening exercises above, and you’ve got a great session!

**Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation**

We’ve all heard of RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Prioritizing rest is key. The body needs time to heal, and recovery can’t be rushed. Use a good ice pack on your knee for 10 minutes at a time, 2-3 times a day, to reduce pain and swelling. Compression can provide support for the knee, though it won’t speed up recovery. Elevating the knee can help reduce swelling as well.

Don't push yourself, and you’ll be back to normal in no time.

### Preventing Runner's Knee

Preventing Runner's Knee boils down to consistent stretching and strength exercises, plus learning how to gradually build your weekly mileage. Stretching and strength work are crucial for preparing your body for long runs, speed sessions, and recovery runs.

Even though I knew all of this, in late September 2024, I got hit with Runner's Knee again! Unlike last time, though, I knew how to handle it. I worked through the recovery process with confidence, knowing I’d be back to running in no time.
