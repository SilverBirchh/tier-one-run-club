Some of the my favourite sessions involve reps that get faster as they the session continues. It works on so any levels forcing you to work harder for each rep. This session starts at a high distance. Going from 1000m then to 800m and ending in a fast 400m/200m. It's not an all out end you have to have some sort of control to make sure you get around. That's what this session is about, control!

## Session Details

**Pacing**  
You should each set at your current 5km pace and get faster with each shorter rep. Going to your 3km pace and ending with you mile pace.

**Recovery**  
Between intervals you will have a 200m jog recovery. Between sets the sets you a 400m jog recovery. Recovery should be a light jog and be consistent. If 400m takes you 4 minutes, the 200m should take 2 minutes.
