This session brings out the rarely seen 300m rep, a distance that isn't quite all out sprint but not quite endurance. Paired with 600m efforts at 5k pace, this workout keeps the intensity high from start to finish.

Each set combines a sharp 300m at mile pace with a longer 600m at 5k pace, with minimal recovery between. The short walks give you just enough time to reset, but not enough to fully recover. It's a session that builds your ability to handle repeated surges and sustained tempo running.

This session is all about the accumulation of lactate and fatigue. Each set feels manageable, but the short recoveries mean fatigue builds steadily. By the final set, holding those paces requires real concentration.

### Session Details
