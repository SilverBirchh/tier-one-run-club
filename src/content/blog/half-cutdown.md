This session is all about working with other runners through the long reps before sharpening up with faster, shorter efforts. The session starts with 1600m reps at 10km race pace. Then it cuts the distance down step by step until you’re going all out at 5km race for some 800m and 400m reps.

This session tests your endurance at 10km pace. It works your aerobic system. The shorter 800m and 400m efforts push you closer to your 5km intensity, improving your ability to change gears late in a run or race.
