One thing that I've yet to do in these track sessions is change up the the pace during a rep. I don't think I've ever done it myself either in the 10 years I've been running. So for the first session of 2025 I thought we might give it a go!

The session is a mix of 400m and 800m intervals with a slight twist. On 400s, you are sprinting the last 100m and on 800s, you are sprinting the last 200m. This makes the session feel quick and quite exciting. You're asking the body to give you more and simulating the last kick of a race. After each 400m rep you have 200m recovery and after each 800m rep you have 400m recovery.

This is also a great chance to get competitive within our group, keep track of how many reps each person wins and crown the champion at the end. This can push you to go even faster! 

As always, please be sure to warm up before diving in and starting. A 15-minute jog, activation exercises, strides, and dynamic stretches should do it. After completing the session, cool down with a light jog and stretches to help recovery.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
The 400m should be run faster than your current 5km pace and the 100m sprint should be at your mile pace. The 800m you can slow it down to just faster than your 10km pace. Keeping the 200m sprint at your mile pace.

**Recovery Instructions**  
After each 400m rep you have 200m recovery and after each 800m rep you have 400m recovery. Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - try to avoid walking or coming to a complete stop.
