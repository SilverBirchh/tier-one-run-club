For the final interval session of 2024 at the club, we did a super fun session where we were running at multiple different paces. It was a short/long/shorter session targeting 400m, 800m, and finally 200m distances. I love the chance to really test out how fast my legs can go, so this was a great session for me.

The format is as follows, and the number of reps you complete depends on your ability: First, a set of 400m intervals with 200m recovery between each rep. This is followed by a set of 800m intervals with 400m recovery. Finally, a set of 200m intervals with 200m recovery.

This session targets multiple running systems. The faster efforts target your speed endurance and lactate tolerance. Your body has to work hard to remove the built-up lactate. The goal with these intervals is to teach the body to run well when fatigued. This is especially true of the 200m reps. When these are done after the longer 800m, your body is already quite tired, so you have to work extra hard physically and mentally to really kick on and run fast. The 800m reps target your lactate threshold, where your body is just about clearing the lactate that it's building up. This helps in race day situations where you need to manage your pace and teach your body to work that little bit harder.

As always, please be sure to warm up before diving in and starting. A 15-minute jog, activation exercises, strides, and dynamic stretches should do it. After completing the session, cool down with a light jog and stretches to help recovery.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
The 400m should be run faster than your current 5km pace. The 800m you can slow it down to just faster than your 10km pace. And you really want to go for it on the 200m, running at you mile pace.

**Recovery Instructions**  
Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop.
