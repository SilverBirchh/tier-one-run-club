Today I run my first session on the track! This also marks the first real step on my journey to become a running coach. I was quite nervous before the session going over my intro many many times. But in the end I had nothing to worry about!

Before the session I had to run some drills. I was not prepared for this but managed to think on my feet. I will have to do some research for next time. I did high knees, but kicks, gates and strides. But I am sure there are more I can to get people warmed up. Maybe some stretches as well?

The session was “500m Chasers”. You work in pairs for a series of intervals on the track. One runner will set off first, with the goal of staying ahead. After 50 meters, the second runner will start, aiming to catch their partner before we reach the 500-meter mark. This session works on…


1. **Speed Development:** By trying to catch the runner ahead, each participant is pushed to run
faster than they might typically do on their own. This helps develop speed and improves
anaerobic capacity.

2. **Race Simulation:** The concept of chasing someone down simulates the competitive aspect of
racing, which can help runners mentally prepare for real races where they might need to
strategically pace themselves and make moves to catch competitors.

3. **Endurance:** Repeating this exercise 10 times at varying distances challenges both speed
and endurance. It can help improve overall cardiovascular fitness and stamina.

4. **Fun and Motivating:** Working in pairs adds an element of fun and camaraderie to the
training session. It can also be motivating to have a specific target to chase, which can
push runners to give their best effort.

5. **Variety:** It breaks away from the monotony of traditional interval training by adding a
playful and competitive twist. This variety can keep athletes engaged and excited about
their training.

Depending on your ability you can do 7 to 10 intervals. This is a great session to push runners while being quite fun for them!

Here’s to the next session!
