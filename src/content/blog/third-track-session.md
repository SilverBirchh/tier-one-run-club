For my third track session ever the group was running 400m chunks. This is an intense session that gives you just enough recovery in between each chunk to get get going again. The session is as follows:

Warm up <br />
4 x 400m / 200m recovery<br />
800m recovery<br />
4 x 400m / 200m recovery<br />
800m recovery<br />
4 x 400m / 200m recovery<br />
800m recovery<br />
Cool down<br />

Total: 9km

Pacing is crucial in this session due to the intensity of the hard running. However, the 800m recovery between each block should allow you to maintain a relatively high effort. Ideally, you should aim to run the 400m intervals slightly faster than your current 5km pace.
