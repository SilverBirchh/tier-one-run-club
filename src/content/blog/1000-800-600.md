This week we ran a clean, effective descending session: 1000m, 800m, and 600m repeats with a consistent 200m recovery jog after every rep. The volume scales by group so everyone gets high-quality work without overreaching.

Use this as a controlled speed-endurance workout. Keep the first reps smooth, then tighten the screws as the reps shorten. Aim for even or slightly negative splits across distances.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
1000m: around current 5K pace
800m: a touch quicker than 5K pace  
600m: closer to 3K pace, but stay composed

**Recovery Instructions**  
Always take a 200m light jog between every hard rep. Keep moving—avoid standing still.

**Group 1**  
2 × 1000m → 2 × 800m → 1 × 600m

**Group 2**  
2 × 1000m → 2 × 800m → 2 × 600m

**Group 3**  
2 × 1000m → 2 × 800m → 2 × 600m

**Group 4**  
2 × 1000m → 2 × 800m → 3 × 600m
