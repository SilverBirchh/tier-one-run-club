I've had a lot of different gear since I started running. I began with a Garmin Forerunner 645 Music. This was a fantastic watch and lasted me about 5 years before I upgraded. In all the time I had that watch, I never scratched it once. I've had my Forerunner 265 for about 3 months now, and there's already a massive line across the front! For trainers, I've gone through loads of different brands, including Mizuno, Brooks, and Asics. I've also never had a shoe rotation until recently. I think I've finally landed on some of my favourite trainers now. It’s taken enough time to try and find them! Here’s the gear I currently use:

### Watch

I recently upgraded my watch to the Garmin Forerunner 265. I briefly had a Coros Pace 3 for a couple of weeks but returned it. The Coros was great, but I missed all the bells and whistles that the Garmin had. I really value having music storage and payment features. It means I can go out without my phone and switch off from the world. If I need anything, I can use the watch. The bright AMOLED screen is ideal—it's crisp and clear. I've never had trouble reading the screen in bright sunlight either.

### Daily Trainers

My daily trainers are the Nike Pegasus 38. They’re okay. They get the job done and can be used for a wide variety of runs, from slow sessions to faster reps. I picked them up because they were on sale, and the price was great. They’ve started to wear out now, and I’m not sure I’d get another pair. They’re good shoes, but I think it might be nice to mix things up for shoes you’re going to wear most days. I like the look of the Novablast.

### Super Shoes

For a long time, I held off buying a pair of super shoes. I didn’t really need them. But at a club event, I tried on a friend’s pair, and wow! They were incredible. You really bounce off the ground. They were light, colourful, and fast. They were the Vaporfly 2, and I immediately knew I had to get a pair. Shortly after that event, I signed up for the Barcelona Marathon and occasionally wore them during training. But when I finally raced in them, I was blown away! They kept me running at a pace I thought was impossible for the entire marathon. I wouldn’t have been able to achieve the time I did without them. I don’t know what I’ll do when they start to wear out—hopefully, I can find another pair somewhere.

### Recovery Trainers

These are my absolute favorite trainers. They are so plush and comfy, absorbing every step and protecting your calves. That’s why I love them for recovery runs. If my legs are beat up from a speed session the day before, these ensure I’m not beating them up more. I don't think you get going particularly fast in them, but you don’t need to.

### Super Trainers

These are my latest purchase. After training for Barcelona in the Pegasus, I found I wasn’t hitting the kilometre splits I wanted to. I was only hitting them on the rare occasion I wore the Vaporflys. So after that race, I went looking for a durable trainer that could help me hit faster paces. There are lots of different options on the market, like the Adidas Boston line or the New Balance SuperComp. But I chose these because they have a carbon plate, look fantastic, and had great reviews. And they are great. They are damn quick, and I think they’ll last quite a long time!

I'm hoping that with this shoe rotation, they should last me quite a while. Maybe I need to add a trail shoe to the mix! Although the Pegs are starting to deteriorate, I think I'll pick up a new pair over Christmas!
