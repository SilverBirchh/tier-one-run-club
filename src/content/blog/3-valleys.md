This week we're tackling pyramid intervals with a long-medium-short-medium-long pattern. Starting at 5km pace and building speed through each rep, with consistent 200m recovery between all intervals.

**### Session Details**

**Pacing Guidelines**
Start each pyramid at around your 5km race pace and build speed progressively through the set. The shortest distance (200m) should be your fastest rep, with each distance getting slightly quicker than your baseline 5km effort. Focus on smooth acceleration rather than dramatic pace changes.

**Recovery Instructions**
Maintain a steady 200m recovery jog between all intervals regardless of the rep distance. Keep moving consistently - avoid walking or stopping completely. The uniform recovery helps maintain rhythm throughout the session.
