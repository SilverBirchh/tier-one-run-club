We're trying some 10k specific work this week. Doing a set of 1200m reps at 10km pace with 400m recovery, followed by a set of 200m reps at mile pace with 200m recovery.

### Session Details

**Pacing Guidelines**  
The 1200m should be at your 10km race pace. This session is all about finding out what that pace is. Take the first few laps to find what works best for you. The 200m should be run at your mile pace. These are quick reps that stimulate the last kick of a race!

**Recovery Instructions**  
Maintain a light jog during recovery periods - avoid walking or coming to a complete stop. Everything should be consistent, the 200m recovery should be half of the 400m recovery.
