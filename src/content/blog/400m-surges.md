This weeks session is simple yet challenging. You think it's easy but by the time the last fast rep comes around, you'll be glad! The session is simply 400m reps completed at 10k pace. Except that every 3rd rep is run at 5km race pace. This is a great workout that practices a race day situation. It might be when you turn a corner in a race and need to drop the competitor behind you.

So, for example, if your target race pace is 45 mins for 10K, and 22 mins for 5K, then you aim to do your 400s in:
1:48, 1:48, 1:45, 1:48, 1:48, 1:45 etc.

### Session Details
